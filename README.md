# thai-swift


Swift bindings for Lib-Thai, in future would like to rewrite as native swift without lib-thai c needed


First install libthai for OSX
```bash
brew tap voxlyhq/homebrew-libthai
brew install libthai
```

Then open the xcode project and the "ExampleThaiText" commandline program is a good example
